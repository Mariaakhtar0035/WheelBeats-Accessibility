        <summary>Our Goal</summary>
        <br>We were tasked with the job to help make life a little simpler for a client dealing with spina bifida. For many in wheelchairs, the idea of going to concerts at large venues can be anxiety enducing due to the lack of accessible information regarding how to navigate through new and unknown areas.<br><br>For this reason, we developed an app which compiles all the information one would need about different Venues near by. WheelBeats aims to provide a platform where the client can easily find accessibility details for various venues, allowing them to make informed decisions and enjoy events without barriers.

        <summary>Our Process</summary>
                <p>It took us extensive time and dedication to get WheelBeats to where it is today</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Our group spent lots of time planning and prototyping. Initially we planned to make an app which displayed accessible bus routes.</li>
                    <li>We then slowly moved over towards the idea of accessible information about venues. Thus creating, VenueVista! <br><br><img src="images/AboutPage/proto1.png" alt="" height="300px" width="500px"> <br> <img src="images/AboutPage/proto2.png" alt="" height="300px" width="400px"></li>
                    <li>From there, we further developed more detailed prototypes and gathered all of the information necessary for 17 different venues. </li>
                    <li>Quickly our information was added onto VenueVista for the first time, and we added a logo!

                    </li>
                    <li>After lots of testing, calling and revising our app recieved drastic rennovations - including an updated name, WheelBeats!</li>
                    <li>Finally our app was ready for launch!</li>
                </ol>
